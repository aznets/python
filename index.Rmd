description: "These notes serve as an introduction to R, but certainly is not comprehensive. The intention is to teach students enough to be able to work with data frames and make graphs using ggplot2. I also cover a range of common data issues that PhD students often have to address."

# Preface {-}

This book is intended to guide people that are completely new to programming along a path towards a useful skill level using R.  I belive that while people can get by with just copying code chunks, that doesn't give them the background information to modify the code in non-trivial ways. Therefore we will spend more time on foundational details than a "crash-course" would.


There is a manuel that shows how to use R that avoids many of the additional packages that I will use.
[cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf).

Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham have a book, [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) that is very good and lays out the foundational ideas behind Hadley's _tidyverse_.
